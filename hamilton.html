      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>Margaret Hamilton is an American computer scientist. Her love of math led her to begin following through on becoming a math professor. However, a post-graduate job at MIT led her to learn she had a knack for writing computer programs. At the time, computer science was not yet an established discipline of study. She wrote software for predicting weather and then for the Air Force to help identify unfriendly aircraft. With her abilities known, NASA offered her a position to create software for the Apollo lunar exploration program. "Software engineering" is said to be her term. President Barack Obama, presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, the highest civilian honor in the United States.</p>
